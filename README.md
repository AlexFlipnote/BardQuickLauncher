# BardQuickLauncher
Python script that launches multiple XIVLauncher instances

I simply wanted to have a script to launch multiple accounts at the same time instead of manually doing it with XIVLauncher shortcuts. So in the end, I made this project to make my life more comfortable, with automatic OTP macro support included.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or above
- [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) (With "Auto Login" enabled)
  - [BardToolBox](https://github.com/BardToolbox/BardToolbox-Release)

## Setup
1. Rename `config.ini.example` to `config.ini`
2. Fill in the values in `config.ini`
3. Run the `index.py` script

## Support
Do you need help, you can always come and ask me in the `#support` channel.

## One Time Password support
> It's very limited at the moment, but I plan to add more.
- XIVLauncher "OTP macro support" enabled
- 1Password (Requires 1Password CLI installed)
  - Format: `1password:PROFILE_NAME`

## config.ini values
> Anything marked with `?` is optional
